expenses / time / information.
● A user can see the sum of the subtasks aggregated in the parent task - so that in his shopping list he can see what contributes to the overall sum. For example I can have a task “Salad”, where he'd add all ingredients as sub-tasks, and would see how much does salad cost on my shopping list, how much time he'd need and how much items are in the do-to
● A user can create multiple to-do lists where each list has it's unique URL that he can share with my friends - so that he could have separate to do lists for my groceries and work related tasks
● A user can change the order of tasks via drag & drop
● A user can sea all created lists in the lists page, delete or enter them

## About the project - style and CSS

I decided to use relatively new design trend and a term that’s gotten a good amount of buzz lately -Neumorphism (aka neomorphism). I followed soft and minimal design.
